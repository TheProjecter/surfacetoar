This project provides an easy-to-access Objective-C wrapper over the popular ARToolkitPlus developed by the Christian Doppler Laboratory (http://studierstube.icg.tu-graz.ac.at/handheld_ar/artoolkitplus.php).

The project ties together ARTPK and the iPhone camera code for multimarker tracking. It also provides a server-client networking system to interface the iPhone client with a digital table for more sophisticated augmented reality projects.

The sample applications included make use of closed-source libraries and models from the LINDSAY Virtual Human project. To gain access to them, please contact the Evolutionary & Swarm Design Lab at the University of Calgary for licensing information (http://www.swarm-design.org/).
